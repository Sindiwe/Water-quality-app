# Water-quality-app
# 💧 Water Quality Predictor

This is a Streamlit web app that predicts whether water is safe to drink (potable) based on physicochemical properties.

## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on the [Water Potability dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability) to predict whether a water sample is drinkable.

### ✅ Features

- Accepts user input for pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, and more.
- Returns a prediction: **Safe to Drink ✅** or **Not Safe ❌**
- Easy-to-use interface built with **Streamlit**
